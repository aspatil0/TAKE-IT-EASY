-**✅ Project Overview: Take It Easy (TIE)**
Goal:
Provide students with structured guidance and complete domain knowledge based on their engineering branch and interest (e.g., Web Dev, App Dev, AI/ML, etc.).

🏗️ Tech Stack
Frontend: React.js + Tailwind CSS (optional for styling)

Backend: Node.js + Express.js

Database: MongoDB (with Mongoose) or MySQL

Authentication: JWT + bcrypt

Deployment: Vercel (Frontend) + Render / Railway / Heroku (Backend) or use VPS for full control

1. Public Pages (No Login Required)
Home Page: Brief intro of TIE, benefits, CTA for login/register.

About Page: Vision, team, mission, etc.

2. Authentication
Register Page: Name, Email, Password, Confirm Password, College Name, Branch

Login Page: Email + Password

Use JWT Tokens for session management

Optionally use cookies for persistence

3. User Dashboard (After Login)
After login:

User selects Branch/Stream: (CSE, ENTC, Mechanical, etc.)

Redirect to branch-specific domain list page

Example Flow:
Choose CSE

Redirect to CSE Domains: Web Dev, App Dev, AI/ML, Blockchain, Cybersecurity, etc.

Click on Web Dev → See all the following:

4. Domain Page Features
Each domain page contains:

Section	Description
Top Companies	List of companies hiring in that domain (with avg package)
Roadmap	Visual or step-by-step roadmap (Frontend → Backend → DB → DevOps...)
Required Skills	Skills needed, divided by level (Beginner/Intermediate/Advanced)
